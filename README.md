The project focuses on simulating a Tesla Coil using LTSpice to demonstrate its working principle virtually.
A Tesla Coil is a type of resonant transformer circuit invented by Nikola Tesla in 1891. It is designed to generate high voltage, low current, and high-frequency AC electricity.

The main purpose of this design is to wirelessly transmit electrical power by boosting voltage to very high levels while maintaining low current. The system works by carefully tuning the primary and secondary circuits to resonance, which allows maximum energy transfer.

Key elements:

Primary Circuit – Contains a power source, a capacitor, and a primary coil (inductor).

Secondary Circuit – Contains a secondary coil (inductor) and a load, often represented as a spark gap or high-voltage terminal.

The resonance condition is achieved by selecting the right values of L (Inductance) and C (Capacitance) using the formula:

f=1/2πrootLC

where 

f is the resonant frequency.

Implementation in LTSpice

In LTSpice, you simulated the Tesla Coil circuit to visualize how high voltage and high frequency are generated.

Steps implemented:

Primary Circuit Design:

A voltage source was used to supply AC power.

A capacitor (C1) was connected in parallel or series with the primary coil (L1) to form an LC circuit.

This LC circuit was tuned to a specific resonant frequency.

Secondary Circuit Design:

The secondary coil (L2) was connected with a high voltage terminal and lightly coupled to the primary coil.

LTSpice uses a mutual inductance element (K statement) to define the magnetic coupling between L1 and L2.

Resonance Adjustment:

The values of L1, L2, and C1 were carefully chosen to match resonance for efficient power transfer.

The simulation demonstrated the build-up of voltage on the secondary side.

Simulation Run:

A transient analysis was performed in LTSpice to observe how voltage builds over time.

The output showed high-frequency oscillations and a rise in secondary coil voltage.

Outcome

The simulation successfully demonstrated high voltage generation at the secondary coil.

It provided a clear visualization of resonant energy transfer between the primary and secondary circuits.
